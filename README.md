# Hi, I'm Gregor! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
As a software engineer, I design, develop, test, and maintain software applications to solve specific problems or meet business needs. I work as part of a team and use a variety of programming languages, tools, and techniques to create software that is reliable, efficient, and scalable. I have a strong understanding of computer science fundamentals and excellent problem-solving and communication skills. My work may involve developing new software from scratch, improving existing software, or integrating different software systems together. Ultimately, my goal is to create software that helps people or organizations achieve their goals in a cost-effective and efficient way.
